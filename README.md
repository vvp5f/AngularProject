# Myshop

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.5.
This is another version of https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/organic-shop that I built while taking Mosh's Angular course:
http://programmingwithmosh.com/courses/complete-angular-master-class/. 

the extra value of this project:
It uses newer versions of NPM packages. 
Angular and many packages made major updates after Mosh published his course and many APIs changed, eg:  angularfire2, rxjs....
If you are coding along with Mosh's angular course and especially for those coding from scratch, the source code in this repo can help you to solve many unexpected errors.
or If you want to learn angular and firebase with latest NPM packages, this repo should also be helpful.
this project is deployed on https://myshop-60486.firebaseapp.com/ & 
https://tyhxx.github.io/Angular-firebase-onlineShop/

Highly recommend to subscribe Mosh's courses if you want to learn front-end/back-end development.
you can find his courses on Udemy or on his own page http://programmingwithmosh.com/. Also many free resource on his youtube channel.

Enjoy coding.
